                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">I was born in 1997 in the city of Vanadzor,Lori region.At the age of
                    2 my family moved to the capital Yerevan and we still live here. I attended primary school No 179 in
                    Yerevan in 2004, then high school No 105 in 2013,with a focus on history and law subjects.In 2015,I
                    enrolled in the Department of Journalism at Yerevan State University. In 2018, in parallel with my
                    undergraduate studies, I started attending an art studio,where I mastered creativity. I graduated
                    from the Department of Journalism at 2019.The same year, I had experience working in the newsroom of
                    Public Television. In 2019,I enrolled a master's degree in Public Relations & Communication
                    Technology in the same Department, where I began studying public relations.I graduated from the art
                    studio in 2020. In parallel with my studies at university, I began to acctively create, in
                    particular I practiced painting & established my own clothing brand,the basis of which is clothe
                    modeling & creative work in the context of painting on textiles. In 2021 I graduated with honors
                    with a master's degree in public relations.As the begining of creativity activity I will single out
                    making clay jewelry, which,however,didn't have a long life and lasted for half a year.Along with
                    attending the art studio,I painted on canvases and it became a source of inspiration for me. At the
                    end of 2019, I created Poghosianarts,my own brand of painted clothe, which has become an even
                    greater source of motivation.I'm engaged in both painting and painting in textile focusing on the
                    role of public relations at the basis of both activities.I have painted over 50 canvases and over
                    800 outfits, the latter mostly on an order basis.The canvases are entirely my creations,and the
                    clothes are sometimes the result of being inspired by motives from famous paintings.But for half a
                    year now I have been painting only my own creations on clothes. In doing so, I have often introduced
                    myself to the public and as a result of my activism through the media I have talked about my
                    creations, which I work on daily.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">On april 9, 2022 I opened my first solo exhibition at the Union of
                    Artists of Armenian, where I presented my original paintings, modeled clothes, and outfits created
                    on the bases of applied art. The exhibition ended on April 13. I use social media,especially
                    Instagram and Facebook, as a platform to spread creative activity. In the near future I am going to
                    open my own personal studio of applied art, where I will also teach people iterested in this
                    direction. My plans definitly included both opening a studio and holding an exhibition and there is
                    one more thing that I haven't implemented yet. Let me open a parenthesis and say that it is about
                    having a shwroom. First I held the exhibiton, because the moment was ripe and I had so much work to
                    present to the public and people could see and appreciate my work. The exhibition presented
                    absolutely my own works, as well as paintings created on the basis of samples of Artsakh's
                    century-old carpet weaving, particularly applied art, namely paintings presented on clothing.The
                    step was to open an art studio, which I will talk about next.</p>
